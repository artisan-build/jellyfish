# Jellyfish

This starter kit by [Artisan Build](https://artisn.build) is a bare-bones Laravel installation with
its skeleton removed.

We use this starter kits when building our applications using [Recipes for Laravel](https://laravel.recipes)
because it allows us to configure everything the way we want it without inheriting any preferences from
a starter kit or the default Laravel skeleton.
